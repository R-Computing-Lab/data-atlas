Mason Garrison 2024-06-22 Abstract The adage ‘A picture is worth a thousand words’ is just as applicable to Behavior Genetics as it is to journalism. In this talk, I delve into the rich diverse history of data visualization techniques in the field of behavior genetics, tracing advancements from Wright’s (Wright 1920) classic path diagram of guinea pigs to the contemporary usage of Manhattan plots. This survey sets the stage for the development of two resources aimed at bolstering the field’s visualization toolkit. The first, an atlas employing ‘ggplot2’ in R, aims to guide researchers in selecting the most appropriate visualization techniques for their data. The second, a proposed R package, seeks to facilitate the integration of ‘OpenMx’-compatible visualizations, streamlining the presentation of complex genetic analyses. Emphasizing practical advice, the talk will cover effective uses of path diagrams, family trees, and interaction visualizations, with the goal of improving clarity and interpretability of genetic data. This initiative aspires to democratize advanced data visualization tools, making them more accessible to the behavior genetics community and, in turn, amplifying the impact and reach of its research. "],["preface.html", "Preface How to use these notes", " Preface In the dynamic field of behavior genetics, the ability to visualize complex data clearly and effectively is not just a technical skill but a narrative art. This document, accompanying the talk on the historical and innovative approaches to data visualization in behavior genetics, introduces the fundamentals of employing ggplot2, a powerful and versatile package in R for creating quality graphics. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse, an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. At the heart of ggplot2 is the concept of a layered grammar of graphics, which allows users to create graphics in a step-by-step, clear and logical way. This framework not only simplifies plotting complex data but also encourages a deeper understanding of the graphical representation itself—making it an ideal tool for behavior geneticists seeking to unvail the hidden stories within their data. The Data Atlas presented here is designed to serve as a practical guide through the landscape of data visualization techniques specific to the field of behavior genetics. It offers a curated selection of graphical methods that range from the foundational, such as Wright’s classic path diagrams, to the advanced, like the interaction visualizations and Manhattan plots, which have become indispensable in the modern geneticist’s toolkit. Further, this document and the accompanying talk address the development of an innovative R package tailored to integrate with OpenMx and BGmisic, projects aimed at facilitating advanced statistical modeling of complex genetic data. This package is proposed to enhance the ggplot2 environment, making it more conducive to the specialized needs of behavior genetics research—such as the visualization of path diagrams and family trees that are not only informative but are also aesthetically compelling. As we proceed, this introduction will delve into the specifics of ggplot2 usage in R, demonstrating how this tool can be adapted to meet the unique challenges of visualizing behavioral and genetic data. By bridging the gap between traditional methods and contemporary demands, the resources developed aim to democratize advanced data visualization tools, thereby expanding the accessibility and impact of behavior genetics research.

The tidyverse packages share a common philosophy and syntax, making it easy to learn and use them together. The resulting code is self-documenting, and thus easier to maintain, read, and share, making it ideal for data analysis and visualization. This crash course is extremely abridged. For a more in-depth treatment of the tidyverse, I recommend checking out my multimedia textbook Data Science for Psychologists and the R for Data Science book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. 1.1 What is the Tidyverse? The tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a common philosophy and syntax. The packages are designed to work together to make data manipulation and visualization easier and more intuitive. The tidyverse includes some of the most popular and widely used R packages, such as ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and readr. These packages are built on the principles of tidy data, which is a standard way of organizing data that makes it easy to work with. 1.1.1 Tidy data Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Leo Tolstoy Tidy data has the following properties: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. Tidy data is easy to manipulate, visualize, and model, and it is the preferred format for data analysis in the tidyverse. The tidyverse packages are designed to work with tidy data, and they provide tools and functions that make it easy to transform and visualize data in this format. Untidy data does not have these properties, and it can be more difficult to work with. 1.2 What’s the Difference between Base R and the Tidyverse? There are some key differences between base R and the tidyverse. I like to think of them as different dialects. (I’ll often say I was raised in based R.) Base R is powerful and flexible, but it can be difficult to learn and use, especially for beginners. The tidyverse, on the other hand, is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a consistent syntax and a focus on data manipulation and visualization. The tidyverse also includes a number of functions and tools that make common data analysis tasks easier and more intuitive. Someone who is familiar with base R might notice several key differences when they’re introduced to the tidyverse. In my experience the main differences are: Syntax and Readability: The tidyverse uses a more consistent and readable syntax that emphasizes clarity and the flow of operations. For example, it leverages the %&gt;% pipe operator from the magrittr package extensively, allowing for code to be written in a way that is easy to read from left to right, much like a series of steps. Pipe operators are used in many programming languages to chain together operations. In R, the pipe operator %&gt;% is used to pass the output of one function to the next function as the first argument. This allows you to write code in a way that is easy to read and understand, with each step of the data analysis process clearly laid out. To use the pipe operator, you simply place it between two functions, like this: output &lt;- function1(input) %&gt;% function2() When these pipes are chained together, they create a clear and readable sequence of operations that can be easily understood by others. This makes it easier to write and maintain code, and it can also help you avoid errors by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Here’s an example of how the pipe operator can be used to chain together a series of data manipulation operations in the tidyverse: data %&gt;% filter(condition) %&gt;% select(variables) %&gt;% mutate(new_variable = expression) %&gt;% group_by(grouping_variable) %&gt;% summarize(summary_statistic) Much of the rest of the differences are which functions are used for common tasks. For example: - Data Manipulation: While base R uses functions like subset, merge, and apply, the tidyverse offers dplyr which provides functions like filter, select, mutate, summarize, and join. These functions are often seen as more intuitive and powerful for data manipulation tasks. Data Import and Tidying: Base R provides functions like read.table and read.csv for data import, and various base functions for data cleaning and reshaping (e.g., reshape, aggregate). The tidyverse, on the other hand, has readr for reading data and tidyr for tidying data. The tidying functions, such as gather and spread (now evolved into pivot_longer and pivot_wider), focus on the concept of “tidy data” where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table. Handling Factor Variables: In base R, factors are often automatically created when importing data which can lead to unexpected behaviors if not properly managed. The tidyverse’s forcats package provides tools that make factor management more explicit and less error-prone. Functional Programming: Base R uses apply functions like lapply and sapply for operations on lists or vectors. The tidyverse introduces purrr which provides a much needed enhancment for R functional programming with a consistent and coherent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. Other differences are more subtle but can have a big impact on the user experience, such as how graphics can be handled and how data types are stored: - Visualization: Base R uses traditional plotting functions such as plot and hist. The tidyverse offers ggplot2, based on the grammar of graphics, which allows for building plots layer by layer and integrates well with the rest of the tidyverse data manipulation packages. Data Types and Storage: The tidyverse introduces tibbles via the tibble package, which are modern reimaginings of data frames. Tibbles are data frames but slightly tweaked to work better in the tidyverse; for example, they never change a variable’s type when adding rows, don’t use row names, and provide a better print method that shows only the first 10 rows and all columns that fit on the screen. Overall, the tidyverse provides a coherent system of packages that facilitate data manipulation, analysis, and visualization in a way that is generally considered to be more user-friendly, especially for those new to R or programming in general. However, this can also lead to a bit of a learning curve for those deeply entrenched in base R. "],["introduction-to-ggplot2.html", "2 Introduction to ggplot2 2.1 Understanding ggplot2’s Grammar of Graphics 2.2 Case Study: Visualizing Twin Data", " 2 Introduction to ggplot2 In this chapter, we explore the power of ggplot2 within the tidyverse package suite for creating compelling visual representations of twin studies in behavior genetics. ggplot2’s layer-oriented approach to building data visualizations allows researchers to intuitively map out the complexities inherent in twin data, providing insights that are crucial for both hypothesis testing and exploratory data analysis. 2.1 Understanding ggplot2’s Grammar of Graphics ggplot2 is a powerful data visualization package in R that is part of the tidyverse suite of packages. It is based on the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building visualizations. The grammar of graphics is based on the idea that a plot can be decomposed into a set of independent components, such as data, aesthetics, and geoms (geometric objects). By combining these components, ggplot2 allows for the creation of complex and informative visualizations that can be easily customized and extended. The structure of the code for plots can be summarized as follows: ggplot(data = [[dataset]], mapping = aes(x = [[x-variable]], y = [[y-variable]])) + geom_xxx() + other options Each component of the plot is added in layers. The ggplot() function initializes the plot, aes() specifies the aesthetic mappings (how variables are mapped to visual properties), and geom_xxx() adds a geometric object (points, lines, bars, etc.) to the plot. Additional layers can be added to further customize the plot, such as labels, titles, and themes. We’ll dive into these soon enough, but first, let’s walk through a simple example to illustrate the basic structure of a ggplot2 plot. 2.2 Case Study: Visualizing Twin Data To make this more concrete, let’s consider an example using twin data on height from the OpenMX package, which is in the twinData data. These 3,808 pairs of twins are from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Twin Registry. The dataset contains information on the height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of twins, along with their zygosity and other demographic information. library(tidyverse) # Load the tidyverse packages library(OpenMx) # Load the OpenMx package library(BGmisc) # Load the BGmisc package library(conflicted) # to handle conflicts conflicted::conflicts_prefer(OpenMx::vech,dplyr::filter) # Resolve conflicts data(twinData) glimpse(twinData) #&gt; Rows: 3,808 #&gt; Columns: 16 #&gt; $ fam &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18… #&gt; $ age &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… #&gt; $ zyg &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… #&gt; $ part &lt;int&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2… #&gt; $ wt1 &lt;int&gt; 58, 54, 55, 66, 50, 60, 65, 40, 60, 76, 48, 70, 51, 53, 58, 4… #&gt; $ wt2 &lt;int&gt; 57, 53, 50, 76, 48, 60, 65, 39, 57, 64, 51, 67, 51, 55, 57, 5… #&gt; $ ht1 &lt;dbl&gt; 1.70, 1.63, 1.65, 1.57, 1.61, 1.60, 1.75, 1.56, 1.76, 1.70, 1… #&gt; $ ht2 &lt;dbl&gt; 1.70, 1.63, 1.68, 1.65, 1.63, 1.57, 1.77, 1.53, 1.77, 1.73, 1… #&gt; $ htwt1 &lt;dbl&gt; 20.1, 20.3, 20.2, 26.8, 19.3, 23.4, 21.2, 16.4, 19.4, 26.3, 2… #&gt; $ htwt2 &lt;dbl&gt; 19.7, 19.9, 17.7, 27.9, 18.1, 24.3, 20.7, 16.7, 18.2, 21.4, 2… #&gt; $ bmi1 &lt;dbl&gt; 21.0, 21.1, 21.0, 23.0, 20.7, 22.1, 21.4, 19.6, 20.7, 22.9, 2… #&gt; $ bmi2 &lt;dbl&gt; 20.9, 21.0, 20.1, 23.3, 20.3, 22.3, 21.2, 19.7, 20.3, 21.4, 2… #&gt; $ cohort &lt;chr&gt; &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;young… #&gt; $ zygosity &lt;fct&gt; MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, M… #&gt; $ age1 &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… #&gt; $ age2 &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… I’m going to tidy up the data a bit by renaming the columns and removing some unnecessary columns.

This dataset contains 3,808 pairs of Australian twins on the 12 variables. library(tidyverse) library(NlsyLinks) library(discord) library(BGmisc) library(OpenMx) library(conflicted) # to handle conflicts conflicted::conflicts_prefer(OpenMx::vech,dplyr::filter) # Resolve conflicts data(twinData) df_wide &lt;- twinData 3.2 Data Structure Let’s take a look at the structure of the dataset using the class and glimpse functions. class(df_wide) ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; glimpse(df_wide) ## Rows: 3,808 ## Columns: 16 ## $ fam &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18… ## $ age &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… ## $ zyg &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1… ## $ part &lt;int&gt; 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2… ## $ wt1 &lt;int&gt; 58, 54, 55, 66, 50, 60, 65, 40, 60, 76, 48, 70, 51, 53, 58, 4… ## $ wt2 &lt;int&gt; 57, 53, 50, 76, 48, 60, 65, 39, 57, 64, 51, 67, 51, 55, 57, 5… ## $ ht1 &lt;dbl&gt; 1.7000, 1.6299, 1.6499, 1.5698, 1.6099, 1.5999, 1.7500, 1.559… ## $ ht2 &lt;dbl&gt; 1.7000, 1.6299, 1.6799, 1.6499, 1.6299, 1.5698, 1.7698, 1.529… ## $ htwt1 &lt;dbl&gt; 20.0692, 20.3244, 20.2020, 26.7759, 19.2894, 23.4375, 21.2245… ## $ htwt2 &lt;dbl&gt; 19.7232, 19.9481, 17.7154, 27.9155, 18.0662, 24.3418, 20.7476… ## $ bmi1 &lt;dbl&gt; 20.9943, 21.0828, 21.0405, 23.0125, 20.7169, 22.0804, 21.3861… ## $ bmi2 &lt;dbl&gt; 20.8726, 20.9519, 20.1210, 23.3043, 20.2583, 22.3454, 21.2270… ## $ cohort &lt;chr&gt; &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;, &quot;young… ## $ zygosity &lt;fct&gt; MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, MZFF, M… ## $ age1 &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… ## $ age2 &lt;int&gt; 21, 24, 21, 21, 19, 26, 23, 29, 24, 28, 29, 19, 23, 22, 23, 2… As we can see, the dataset contains 3808 observations of 16 variables. Most of these variables include two entries, one for twin 1 and one for twin 2. The zygosity variable indicates the zygosity of the twins, while other variables represent different measurements or characteristics of the twins, and denote which twin they refer to by the suffixes 1 and 2. We can also see that the dataset contains a mix of numeric and character variables. To improve the readability of the dataset, we are going to split the information from the zygosity variable into two separate variables: sex and zyg. This will make it easier to analyze and visualize the data later on. df_wide &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% mutate(sex = case_when(zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZFF&quot;,&quot;DZFF&quot;) ~ &quot;F&quot;, zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZMM&quot;,&quot;DZMM&quot;) ~ &quot;M&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;OS&quot;), zyg = case_when(zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZFF&quot;,&quot;MZMM&quot;) ~ &quot;MZ&quot;, zygosity %in% c(&quot;DZFF&quot;,&quot;DZMM&quot;,&quot;DZOS&quot;) ~ &quot;DZ&quot;, TRUE ~ NA_character_ )) 3.2.1 Annotated explainaton for the code snippet above: The provided R code uses the tidyverse package’s dplyr library to manipulate a data frame named df_wide. The mutate function is used to create new variables or modify existing ones within the data frame. (In this case it is creating sex and over writing zyg. Here’s an annotation of what each part of the code is doing: Data Frame Assignment: df_wide &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% This line indicates that we are taking the existing data frame df_wide and using the %&gt;% operator (pipe) to pass it through additional functions. The result will be stored back into the df_wide. Mutate Function: mutate(sex = ..., zyg = ...) The mutate function is used to add new columns to the data frame or change existing ones. In this case, one new column sex is being added and the existing column zyg is being modified. Creating sex Column: sex = case_when(...) creates a new column named sex based on conditions applied to the zygosity column. The case_when function is similar to a series of if-else statements. For each row, it checks the conditions in order and assigns a value to sex based on the first matching condition. Conditions for sex Column: zygosity %in% c(\"MZFF\",\"DZFF\") ~ \"F\" condition checks if the zygosity value is either “MZFF” or “DZFF”. If true, “F” (Female) is assigned to the sex column. zygosity %in% c(\"MZMM\",\"DZMM\") ~ \"M\" checks if the zygosity value is either “MZMM” or “DZMM”. If true, “M” (Male) is assigned to the sex column. TRUE ~ \"OS\" is a catch-all condition that assigns “OS” (Other or Unknown sex) if none of the above conditions are met. Creating zyg Column: Similar to the sex column, zyg = case_when(...) overwrites an old column zyg that categorizes zygosity into broader categories. Conditions for zyg Column: zygosity %in% c(\"MZFF\",\"MZMM\") ~ \"MZ\" checks if zygosity is either “MZFF” or “MZMM” and assigns “MZ” (Monozygotic) indicating identical twins. zygosity %in% c(\"DZFF\",\"DZMM\",\"DZOS\") ~ \"DZ\" checks if zygosity falls into any of “DZFF”, “DZMM”, or “DZOS”, assigning “DZ” (Dizygotic) indicating fraternal twins. TRUE ~ NA_character_ assigns a missing value (NA) if none of the above conditions are met, possibly used to handle cases where zygosity data is not clearly defined or is missing. This code effectively categorizes individuals in the dataset based on zygosity into more workable groups for sex and twin status, which can (and will) be useful for further analysis and visualization. 3.3 Summary Statistics (Wide Form) Let’s calculate summary statistics for numeric variables across the full sample. This will provide a quick overview of central tendencies and variability in the dataset. When working with wide form data, it is often helpful to start with summarizing by the data structure you already have. In this case, we will calculate summary statistics by specific twin (twin 1 or twin 2). 3.3.1 Numeric Variables Calculate summary statistics for numeric variables across the full sample. This helps provide a quick overview of central tendencies and variability. # Calculate summary statistics for numeric variables across the full sample summary_stats &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list( mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE), median = ~median(., na.rm = TRUE), min = ~min(., na.rm = TRUE), max = ~max(., na.rm = TRUE), IQR = ~IQR(., na.rm = TRUE) ), .names = &quot;{col}_{fn}&quot;)) %&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = everything(), names_to = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;statistic&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot; ) %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = statistic, values_from = value ) summary_stats ## # A tibble: 13 × 7 ## variable mean sd median min max IQR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 fam 1904. 1099. 1904. 1 3808 1904. ## 2 age 34.5 14.2 30 17 88 19 ## 3 part 1.93 0.265 2 0 2 0 ## 4 wt1 62.2 10.9 60 34 111 15 ## 5 wt2 65.6 12.2 65 35 127 16 ## 6 ht1 1.66 0.0896 1.65 1.34 1.98 0.130 ## 7 ht2 1.69 0.0990 1.7 1.40 1.99 0.140 ## 8 htwt1 22.5 3.16 21.9 13.3 41.9 3.84 ## 9 htwt2 22.8 3.19 22.3 14.2 46.2 3.78 ## 10 bmi1 21.7 0.940 21.6 18.1 26.1 1.21 ## 11 bmi2 21.8 0.939 21.7 18.6 26.8 1.18 ## 12 age1 34.5 14.2 30 17 88 19 ## 13 age2 34.5 14.2 30 17 88 19 As you can see in the table above, the summary statistics provide a quick overview of the central tendencies and variability in the dataset for numeric variables. The table includes the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and interquartile range (IQR) for each numeric variable. But they do so by the twin number, which is useful for our purposes, but… isn’t the only descriptive information we’ll need. We will need to calculate these statistics for the full sample, not by twin number. But we’ll still going to start with the twin number, and then we’ll calculate the summary statistics for the full sample. 3.3.2 Frequency Tables Create frequency tables for categorical variables like zygosity and sex, providing a clear picture of the distribution of these categories within the dataset. These numbers are easier to calculation when data are wide like this because we’re actually interested in the dyad, not the individual. # Counting &#39;zygosity&#39; and calculating percentages zygosity_summary &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% count(zyg, name = &quot;count&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100) %&gt;% rename(category = zyg) %&gt;% # Renaming the column for clarity mutate(variable = &quot;zygosity&quot;) # Adding a descriptor column for the variable # Counting &#39;sex&#39; and calculating percentages sex_summary &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% count(sex, name = &quot;count&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100) %&gt;% rename(category = sex) %&gt;% # Renaming the column for clarity mutate(variable = &quot;sex&quot;) # Adding a descriptor column for the variable # Combining both summaries into a single dataframe combined_summary &lt;- bind_rows(zygosity_summary, sex_summary) %&gt;% select(variable, category, everything()) # Reordering columns for clarity combined_summary ## variable category count percentage ## 1 zygosity DZ 2009 52.75735 ## 2 zygosity MZ 1799 47.24265 ## 3 sex F 1983 52.07458 ## 4 sex M 919 24.13340 ## 5 sex OS 906 23.79202 As you can see in the table above, the frequency tables provide a clear picture of the distribution of categories within the dataset for the zygosity and sex. Interestingly, there are many more same sex female twins, which make up 1983/3808 (52%) of the dataset. What if you want to examine these wideform by cohort? You can use the group_by function to group the data by cohort and then calculate the summary statistics for each cohort. library(tidyverse) # Grouping by &#39;cohort&#39; and calculating summary statistics for each group across values that are numeric df_summary &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% group_by(cohort) %&gt;% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list( mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE), median = ~median(., na.rm = TRUE), IQR = ~IQR(., na.rm = TRUE) ), .names = &quot;{.col}_{.fn}&quot;)) %&gt;% # Ensure only statistic columns are being pivoted pivot_longer( cols = -cohort, # Exclude &#39;cohort&#39; from pivoting names_to = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;statistic&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot; ) # lock in the variable order variable_order &lt;- unique(df_summary$variable) df_summary &lt;- df_summary %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = statistic, values_from = value, values_fn = list(value = mean) # Aggregate if necessary ) df_summary %&gt;% mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = variable_order)) %&gt;% arrange(variable, cohort) ## # A tibble: 26 × 6 ## cohort variable mean sd median IQR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 older fam 2859 548. 2859 949 ## 2 younger fam 955 551. 955 954 ## 3 older age 45.4 12.2 42 19 ## 4 younger age 23.5 3.66 23 7 ## 5 older part 1.95 0.224 2 0 ## 6 younger part 1.92 0.299 2 0 ## 7 older wt1 63.8 11.2 62 15 ## 8 younger wt1 60.5 10.3 59 14 ## 9 older wt2 67.0 12.7 66 19 ## 10 younger wt2 64.1 11.6 64 17 ## # ℹ 16 more rows As you can see from the table, the summary statistics are calculated for each cohort across the numeric variables. This provides a quick overview of the central tendencies and variability in the dataset for each cohort. Now, these data are still in wide form, but we can easily convert them to long form if needed. What about descriptive statistics by zygosity and sex? library(tidyverse) # Grouping by &#39;zyg,sex&#39; and calculating summary statistics for each group df_summary &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% group_by(zyg,sex) %&gt;% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list( mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE), median = ~median(., na.rm = TRUE), IQR = ~IQR(., na.rm = TRUE) ), .names = &quot;{.col}_{.fn}&quot;)) %&gt;% # Ensure only statistic columns are being pivoted pivot_longer( cols = -c(zyg,sex), # Exclude &#39;zygosity&#39; from pivoting names_to = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;statistic&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot; ) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;zyg&#39;.

The zygosity variable indicates the zygosity of the twins, while other variables are split into variable and value pairs, reflecting measurements or characteristics of the twins. 5.3 Adding sex and zyg To facilitate analyses that depend on sex or zygosity type, we’ll add these as new columns derived from zygosity. # Add &#39;sex&#39; and &#39;zyg&#39; columns based on &#39;zygosity&#39; df_long &lt;- df_long %&gt;% mutate(sex = case_when( zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZFF&quot;, &quot;DZFF&quot;) ~ &quot;F&quot;, zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZMM&quot;, &quot;DZMM&quot;) ~ &quot;M&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;OS&quot; ), zyg = case_when( zygosity %in% c(&quot;MZFF&quot;, &quot;MZMM&quot;) ~ &quot;MZ&quot;, zygosity %in% c(&quot;DZFF&quot;, &quot;DZMM&quot;, &quot;DZOS&quot;) ~ &quot;DZ&quot;, TRUE ~ NA_character_ )) Unfortunately, the data do not contain the information for the gender for each twin, so we will just have to settle for noting that the data is missing. 5.4 Summary Statistics (Long Form) Once again, let’s calculate summary statistics for numeric variables across the full sample. This will provide a quick overview of central tendencies and variability in the dataset. When working with long form data, it is often helpful to start with summarizing by the data structure you already have. In this case, we will calculate summary statistics by specific measurement across all twins. Data Structure and Summary Statistics Examine the transformed data and calculate summary statistics similar to those performed in the wide form. summary_stats_long &lt;- df_long %&gt;% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list( mean = ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), sd = ~sd(., na.rm = TRUE), median = ~median(., na.rm = TRUE), min = ~min(., na.rm = TRUE), max = ~max(., na.rm = TRUE), IQR = ~IQR(., na.rm = TRUE) ), .names = &quot;{col}_{fn}&quot;)) %&gt;% pivot_longer( cols = everything(), names_to = c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;statistic&quot;), names_sep = &quot;_&quot; ) %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = statistic, values_from = value ) summary_stats_long %&gt;% print(n = 15) # to see more rows ## # A tibble: 7 × 7 ## variable mean sd median min max IQR ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 fam 1904. 1099. 1904. 1 3808 1904. ## 2 part 1.93 0.265 2 0 2 0 ## 3 wt 63.9 11.7 62 34 127 16 ## 4 ht 1.68 0.0958 1.68 1.34 1.99 0.150 ## 5 htwt 22.6 3.18 22.2 13.3 46.2 3.83 ## 6 bmi 21.8 0.941 21.7 18.1 26.8 1.20 ## 7 age 34.5 14.2 30 17 88 19 Generate frequency tables for sex and zyg, paralleling the wide form analysis. # Frequency Tables Paralleling the wide form analysis, let us create frequency tables for categorical variables like zygosity and sex. These tables should provide a clear picture of the distribution of these categories within the dataset. In some ways, these calculations are simpler in long form data because each row is already an individual observation. # Counting &#39;zygosity&#39; and calculating percentages zygosity_summary_long &lt;- df_long %&gt;% count(zyg, name = &quot;count&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100) %&gt;% rename(category = zyg) %&gt;% # Renaming the column for clarity mutate(variable = &quot;zygosity&quot;) # Adding a descriptor column for the variable # Counting &#39;sex&#39; and calculating percentages sex_summary_long &lt;- df_long %&gt;% count(sex, name = &quot;count&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100) %&gt;% rename(category = sex) %&gt;% # Renaming the column for clarity mutate(variable = &quot;sex&quot;) # Adding a descriptor column for the variable # Combining both summaries into a single dataframe combined_summary_long &lt;- bind_rows(zygosity_summary_long, sex_summary_long) %&gt;% select(variable, category, everything()) # Reordering columns for clarity combined_summary_long ## # A tibble: 5 × 4 ## variable category count percentage ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 zygosity DZ 4018 52.8 ## 2 zygosity MZ 3598 47.2 ## 3 sex F 3966 52.1 ## 4 sex M 1838 24.1 ## 5 sex OS 1812 23.8 As you can see, the long form data structure allows for a straightforward calculation of frequency tables for categorical variables. The resulting tables provide a clear picture of the distribution, and it does not differ from the wide form analysis, as long as one remembers to that we’re now looking at individual twins rather than pairs.
