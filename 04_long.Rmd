# Long Form Data


In contrast to wide form data, long form data, also known as "tidy data," structures datasets where each row represents a single observation, and each column represents a variable. This format is highly beneficial for statistical modeling and data analysis because it simplifies the application of various data manipulation and analysis functions. As before, we'll use the `twinData` dataset from the `OpenMx` package, but we'll convert it to long form to illustrate handling and analyzing data in this format.


## Converting from Wide to Long Form
```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, messages=FALSE, ref.label="library"}
```

```{r library, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(NlsyLinks)
library(discord)
library(BGmisc)
library(OpenMx)
library(conflicted) # to handle conflicts
conflicted::conflicts_prefer(OpenMx::vech,dplyr::filter) # Resolve conflicts


data(twinData)

df <- twinData
```
