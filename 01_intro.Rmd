# Introduction to ggplot2

In the dynamic field of behavior genetics, the ability to visualize complex data clearly and effectively is not just a technical skill but a narrative art. This document, accompanying the talk on the historical and innovative approaches to data visualization in behavior genetics, introduces the fundamentals of employing ggplot2, a powerful and versatile package in R for creating quality graphics.

`ggplot2` is part of the `tidyverse`, an opinionated collection of `R` packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. At the heart of `ggplot2` is the concept of a layered grammar of graphics, which allows users to create graphics in a step-by-step, clear and logical way. This framework not only simplifies plotting complex data but also encourages a deeper understanding of the graphical representation itself—making it an ideal tool for behavior geneticists seeking to unvail the hidden stories within their data.

The Data Atlas presented here is designed to serve as a practical guide through the landscape of data visualization techniques specific to the field of behavior genetics. It offers a curated selection of graphical methods that range from the foundational, such as Wright's classic path diagrams, to the advanced, like the interaction visualizations and Manhattan plots, which have become indispensable in the modern geneticist’s toolkit.

Further, this document and the accompanying talk address the development of an innovative R package tailored to integrate with [OpenMx](https://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/) and [BGmisic](https://r-computing-lab.github.io/BGmisc/), projects aimed at facilitating advanced statistical modeling of complex genetic data. This package is proposed to enhance the `ggplot2` environment, making it more conducive to the specialized needs of behavior genetics research—such as the visualization of path diagrams and family trees that are not only informative but are also aesthetically compelling.

As we proceed, this introduction will delve into the specifics of ggplot2 usage in R, demonstrating how this tool can be adapted to meet the unique challenges of visualizing behavioral and genetic data. By bridging the gap between traditional methods and contemporary demands, the resources developed aim to democratize advanced data visualization tools, thereby expanding the accessibility and impact of behavior genetics research.
