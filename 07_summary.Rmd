<!-- I leaned into the cheesiness -->
Throughout this document, we have embarked on an exploration of the evolving landscape of data visualization in the field of behavior genetics. By revisiting historical methodologies and embracing modern techniques, we have uncovered a rich tapestry of visual tools that enhance our understanding and communication of genetic data. The atlas of `ggplot2` visualizations presented here not only serves as a practical guide but also as an inspiration for researchers to think creatively about how data can be visualized more effectively.
